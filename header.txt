C                            3 April 2023 Update
C
C       http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~cline/Gosia/index.html
C
C       Gosia was developed in 1980 by T. Czosnyka, D. Cline and C.Y. Wu at
C       the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.  
C
C       The coding of the Gosia suite of codes was maintained by Tomasz Czosnyka 
C       from 1980 until his untimely death in 2006. Since 2007 Nigel Warr has 
C       upgraded and maintained the coding of Gosia and Gosia2. 
C
C       Responsibility for the management and development of the Gosia suite
C       of codes was assumed by the Steering Committee of the Gosia Users Group
C       in April 2008.
C
C       The Gosia Steering Committee comprises:
C          Douglas Cline, (University of Rochester)
C          Liam Gaffney, (University of Liverpool)
C          Adam Hayes, (University of Rochester)
C          Pawel Napiorkowski, (Warsaw University)
C          Nigel Warr, (University of Cologne)
C          Magda, Zielinska (Warsaw University)
C
C       Valuable to Gosia contributions were made by:
C          L. Hasselgren (Uppsala)
C          A.B. Hayes (Rochester)
C          R. Ibbotson (Rochester)
C          A.E. Kavka (Uppsala and Rochester)
C          B. Kotlinski (Warsaw and Rochester)
C          J. Srebrny  (Warsaw)
C          Eh. Vogt (Munchen and Rochester)

C          Some concepts used come from the 1978 Winther, de Boer code 
C          COULEX and from the deexcitation code CEGRY developed by Cline 
C          and coworkers at Rochester.  However, the parts taken from 
C          both codes are in most cases completely rewritten, so the 
C          similarity of variable and routine names may be misleading.

C       Resources
C          It is recommended that users check the GOSIA website at 
C          Rochester periodically for important updates to the code and 
C          the manual, as well as sample input and output files and other 
C          information. Chapter 11 of this manual provides novice users 
C          with instructions, tutorials, etc.

C       Compiling Gosia 2007
C          Gosia 2007 compiles on most 64-bit systems with GNU g77,
C          using the default compiler settings.  Previous versions of
C          the Gosia code did not explicitly specify 64-bit precision
C          and were intended to be compiled by the user at the highest
C          machine precision available.  The current availability of
C          64-bit machines and the accuracy problems which may arise
C          when relying on 32-bit precision led to the decision to make
C          this code explicitly 64-bit.  Modifying the code to run
C          with 32-bit precision is discouraged.

C          Bug fixes        
C            - CC array is initialised properly (all 50 elements, not just first 20).
C            - Various GOTOs which go to the ENDDO statement of a loop are changed to use
C               a CONTINUE statement just before the ENDDO. This is apparently no longer
C               permitted in Fortran 2003, so some compilers are already forbidding it.
C            - Arrays are passed with dimension '*' now, so they correctly inherit the
C               dimension from the calling function.
C            - cpo and cpo1 arrays in CONV have been extended from 51 to 101.
C            - xx and yy arrays in EFFIX have been extended from 51 to 101.
C            - SAVE arh added in LAGRAN.
C            - The sign of the Woods-Saxon part of the gremlin efficiency calibration has
C               been corrected.
C            - NAME= has been replaced with FILE= in open statements in BRIC as this is
C               an extension, not part of the Fortran standard.
C            - The energy of the gamma is now the absolute value of the difference in
C               energy of the levels, so we don't have negative energies!
C
C          (19 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080519
C            Incorporated the internal conversion coefficient program BrIcc as OP,BRIC
C            Provided option to make CONV use the file generated by OP,BRIC
C            Increased the number of energy levels from 75 to 100.
C            Reordered the declarations for each common block to facilitate building singl program file.
C            Added variable to Gosia to reduce differences between Gosia and Gosia2.
C  
C          (8 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080508
C            Increased number of matrix elements from 500 to 999
C            Added OP,SELE to incorporate the separate program SELECT into Gosia.
C
C          (7 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080507
C            Corrected constants in SEQ
C            Added spline switch SPL to CONT
C
C          (7 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080507
C            Corrected constants in SEQ
C            Added SPL option to CONT
C
C          (18 April 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080418
C            Increased the size of varios arrays for interpolation  
C    
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Changes to the Input Format:
C            Tapes 1 and 2 in the pre-2007 versions have been reassigned 
C            to tapes 11 and 12, respectively, in order to make switching 
C            between Gosia and Gosia2 (the mutual excitation code) easier.
C            This change affects only OP,FILE (optional--see below) and 
C            the default naming of files.  For example, on a typical Unix-like
C            system, the file formerly called "fort.2" will now be called 
C            "fort.12" and will contain the best set of matrix elements 
C            written at the end of the minimization.
C     
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Bugs Fixed  
C            The routine DJMM relies on the values of DJM being
C            preserved between repeated calls to DJMM, which occurred
C            automatically on many older systems (e.g. DEC Alpha, VAX).
C            On some newer machines, DJM was effectively randomized
C            between calls, causing unpredictable errors including
C            negative values of chi-squared.  This was fixed by adding
C            the command "SAVE DJM" to the routine DJMM.
C            The routine ALLOC now handles error conditions gracefully,
C            and execution is halted in the event of a fatal error.
C            The WRN,X. switch in the CONT section of OP,GOSI and 
C            OP,COUL was unintentionally disabled in the 2007 version.
C            It is restored in the present update.
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Explicit 64-bit Precision Upgrade 
C            All routines and functions including the main routine now
C            have "IMPLICIT NONE" declared, and all variables are
C            explicitly defined as either REAL*8, COMPLEX*16, or
C            INTEGER*4.  Numerical constants have been changed as
C            necessary to double precision.  Archaic functions have
C            been updated (below, "Archaic Functions"), in part to
C            preserve 64-bit precision during type-conversions.
C            (Precision in type conversion may be limited in some cases
C            by the compiler.)
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Structure and Standards  
C            Sections of the code have been restructured using Spag 
C            (Polyhedron Software) under the academic license.  This
C            included unraveling of loops and goto statements, and
C            indenting the source code to make loops and if statements
C            more obvious.  The initialization in the main routine has
C            been slightly restructured, mainly to make it similar to
C            the 2007 version of Gosia2.  Other sections have been
C            restructured for clarity, without altering their function
C            (e.g. WTHREJ).
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Common Blocks 
C            The common blocks ME2D, CCC, KIN, COEX, CAUX0, and LCZP
C            were re-ordered so that the 64-bit real variables come
C            before the 32-bit integer variables in order to
C            eliminate alignment problems.  Several unused common
C            blocks were removed from routines.
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Archaic Functions
C            All instances of the following archaic functions have
C            been replaced by their modern counterparts.
C
C                Archaic    Replacement        Archaic    Replacement
C                IFIX       INT                MIN0       MIN  
C                FLOAT      REAL               AMIN1      MIN

C         
C          (June 2006, T. Czosnyka) - The size of the array of
C            internal conversion coefficients (CC) has been increased
C            to 50.
C
C          (Nov 2000, T. Czosnyka) - A Jaeri efficiency calibration
C            has been added.
C
C          (2000) - A FITEFF efficiency calibration has been added
C            with credit to P. Olbratowski, P. Napiorkowski.
C
C          (July 1997, T. Czosnyka) - Known matrix elements of all
C            multipolarities may now be entered as data in OP,YIEL.
C            Note that this necessitates adding the multipole order
C            LAMBDA as the first field in the new input format:
C            LAMBDA, NS1, NS2, ME, DME 
C            where LAMBDA=7 and 8 represent M1 and M2, respectively.
C
C          (September 1996, T. Czosnyka) - The PIN diode particle
C            detector option has been added.  See the entry for
C            "PIN,X."  under the sub-option CONT in the Gosia manual.
C
C          (May 1995, T. Czosnyka) - Added a matrix element generator
C            "OP,THEO" following the "general structure of matrix
C            elements" as given in Bohr & Mottelson vol. II.  Refer to
C            the Gosia manual.
C
C          (April 1991, T. Czosnyka) - The OP,RAW function has been
C            added.  OP,RAW handles non-efficiency-corrected spectra
C            and allows the definition of Ge detector "clusters."  Up
C            to 20 clusters can be defined.  This effectively increases
C            the number of physical Ge detectors to 200, while the
C            number of data sets (i.e. single detectors + cluster
C            detectors) is still limited to 32.
C
C          (April 1991, T. Czosnyka) - Output is now written on unit
C            22 to avoid mixing it with system messages on some
C            systems.
C
C          (November 1990, T. Czosnyka) - The level scheme data
C            arrays have been increased to the following sizes:
C            number of levels   = 75
C            gamma-ray yields   = 32 x 1500
C            magnetic substates = 600
C            matrix elements    = 500
C
C
C          (April 1990, T. Czosnyka) - The dominant multipolarity
C            switch is now ignored by the code and does not need to be
C            set.  Full Q-maps are now calculated for electric
C            multipole orders E1 through E4.  The electric matrix
C            elements up to multipole order E6 may be entered and fit.
C            The Xi and Zeta function ranges are now calculated for
C            each multipolarity individually.
C
C          (1990, Eh. Vogt, T. Czosnyka) - OP,FILE has been added,
C            giving the user the option of specifying descriptive names
C            of the input and output files in the Gosia input, rather
C            than using the Fortran default names fort.1, fort.2, etc.
C            Refer to the Gosia website for sample input files that use
C            OP,FILE.
C
C          (March 1989, T. Czosnyka) - The code has been updated to
C            allow input of data from 32 Ge detectors.  [As of the 2007
C            version, this means a total of 32 X 1500 data points.]
C
C          (1980, T. Czosnyka, D. Cline, C.Y. Wu) - Original version.
