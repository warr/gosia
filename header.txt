C
C       http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~cline/Gosia/index.html
C
C       Gosia was developed in 1980 by T. Czosnyka, D. Cline and C.Y. Wu at
C       the University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.  
C
C       The coding of the Gosia suite of codes was maintained by Tomasz
C       Czosnyka from 1980 until his untimely death in 2006. Since 2007 Nigel
C       Warr has upgraded and maintained the coding of Gosia and Gosia2. 
C
C       Responsibility for the management and development of the Gosia suite
C       of codes was assumed by the Steering Committee of the Gosia Users Group
C       in April 2008.
C
C       The Gosia Steering Committee comprises:
C          Douglas Cline,(University of Rochester)
C          Adam Hayes,  (University fo Rochester)
C          Pawel Napiorkowski, (Warsaw University)
C          Nigel Warr,  (University of Cologne)  
C
C       Valuable to Gosia contributions were made by:
C          L. Hasselgren (Uppsala)
C          A.B. Hayes (Rochester)
C          R. Ibbotson (Rochester)
C          A.E. Kavka (Uppsala and Rochester)
C          B. Kotlinski (Warsaw and Rochester)
C          J. Srebrny  (Warsaw)
C          Eh. Vogt (Munchen and Rochester)

C          Some concepts used come from the 1978 Winther, de Boer code 
C          COULEX and from the deexcitation code CEGRY developed by Cline 
C          and coworkers at Rochester.  However, the parts taken from 
C          both codes are in most cases completely rewritten, so the 
C          similarity of variable and routine names may be misleading.
C
C       Resources
C          It is recommended that users check the GOSIA website at 
C          Rochester periodically for important updates to the code and 
C          the manual, as well as sample input and output files and other 
C          information. Chapter 11 of this manual provides novice users 
C          with instructions, tutorials, etc.

C       Compiling Gosia
C          Gosia compiles on most 64-bit systems with GNU g77, using
C          the default compiler settings.  Previous versions of the
C          Gosia code did not explicitly specify 64-bit precision and
C          were intended to be compiled by the user at the highest
C          machine precision available.  The current availability of
C          64-bit machines and the accuracy problems which may arise
C          when relying on 32-bit precision led to the decision to make
C          this code explicitly 64-bit.  Modifying the code to run
C          with 32-bit precision is discouraged.

C       CHRONOLOGY OF MAJOR CHANGES:
C
C          (2 April 2009, N. Warr) gosia-20081208.4
C          Bug fix

C          (1 February 2009, N. Warr) gosia-20081208.3
C          Bug fix
C            ° Preserve IKIN flag in OP,INTI
C          (27 January 2009, N. Warr) gosia-20081208.2
C          Bug fix
C            ° Fix OP,INTI for target excitations
C          (16 January 2009, N. Warr) gosia-20081208.1
C          Bug fix
C            ° Give an error if limit in omega steps is exceeded
C          (8 December 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20081208
C            <B0> New option OP,INTI which works like OP,INTG but the theta
C              values for the meshpoints are given as angles for the recoiling
C              target nuclei in the laboratory frame. This should help in
C              inverse kinematics cases.
C          (30 June 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080630
C            ° Reordering of all variable declarations so variables in 
C              common blocks are together.
C            ° Increased size of arrays for levels from 75 to 100.
C            ° Change in many format statements to accomodate 100 levels
C               (I2 -> I3).
C            ° Increased size of arrays for substates from 600 to 1200.
C            ° Restructure function EFFIX to allow more flexible selection
C              of efficiency calbration type.
C            ° Added Radware efficiency calibration (Pawel J. Napiorkowski).
C            ° Added EFF, option to CONT to make it easier to select
C              efficiency method.
C            ° Bugfix in gremlin efficiency method: a sign was wrong in
C              Woods-Saxon term.
C            ° Bugfix in initialisation of conversion coefficients for
C              interpolation method (only part of array was initialized).
C            ° Add CONTINUE statements to prevent GOTO the ENDDO of a loop.
C              This is deprecated and will be removed in future.
C            ° Call either LAGRAN or SPLNER to do interpolation according
C              to ISPL variable.
C            ° Approximation in TRINT  if Arg is very large (then ratio is
C              one) as in pawel.
C            ° Replaced OPEN(NAME=xxx) with OPEN(FILE=xxx) as the former is
C              an extension to the language, while the latter is standard.
C            ° Bugfix in BRICC: we need the absolute value of the
C              difference in energy levels not the signed difference.
C            ° Use JZB to indicate which unit to read from as in gosia2.
C            ° Use IUNIT3 to indicate which unit is TAPE3 as in gosia2.
C            ° Use irix variable to select units 7 and 12 as in gosia2.
C            ° Add dummy variable Op2 to ANGULA as in gosia2.
C            ° In OPENF we refuse to open units 25 and 26 unless reading
C              from unit 5 as in gosia2 (however, gosia always reads from unit
C              5, so this does nothing).
C            ° Bugfix for dimension of bten, which should have been 1600
C              and was different in different places.
C            ° Use DCMPLX instead of CMPLX for portability.
C            ° Use DIMAG instead of IMAG for portability.
C            ° Reorder DATA statement in NEWCNV for portability.
C            ° Use LAGRAN for interpolation if there are less than three
C              data points even if ISPL = 1.
C          (26 June 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080519.1
C          Bug fixes        
C            ° CC array is initialised properly (all 50 elements, not just
C               first 20).
C            ° Various GOTOs which go to the ENDDO statement of a loop are
C               changed to use a CONTINUE statement just before the ENDDO.
C               This is apparently no longer permitted in Fortran 2003, so
C               some compilers are already forbidding it.
C            ° Arrays are passed with dimension '*' now, so they correctly
C               inherit the
C               dimension from the calling function.
C            ° cpo and cpo1 arrays in CONV have been extended from 51 to
C               101.
C            ° xx and yy arrays in EFFIX have been extended from 51 to 101.
C            ° SAVE arh added in LAGRAN.
C            ° The sign of the Woods-Saxon part of the gremlin efficiency
C               calibration has been corrected.
C            ° NAME= has been replaced with FILE= in open statements in
C               BRIC as this is an extension, not part of the Fortran standard.
C            ° The energy of the gamma is now the absolute value of the
C               difference in energy of the levels, so we don't have negative
C               energies!
C
C          (19 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080519
C            Incorporated the internal conversion coefficient program BrIcc
C            as OP,BRIC
C            Provided option to make CONV use the file generated by OP,BRIC
C            Increased the number of energy levels from 75 to 100.
C            Reordered the declarations for each common block to facilitate
C            building singl program file.
C            Added variable to Gosia to reduce differences between Gosia and
C            Gosia2.
C  
C          (8 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080508
C            Increased number of matrix elements from 500 to 999
C            Added OP,SELE to incorporate the separate program SELECT into
C            Gosia.
C
C          (7 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080507
C            Corrected constants in SEQ
C            Added spline switch SPL to CONT
C
C          (7 May 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080507
C            Corrected constants in SEQ
C            Added SPL option to CONT
C
C          (18 April 2008, N. Warr) gosia-20080418
C            Increased the size of varios arrays for interpolation  
C    
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Changes to the Input Format:
C            Tapes 1 and 2 in the pre-2007 versions have been reassigned 
C            to tapes 11 and 12, respectively, in order to make switching 
C            between Gosia and Gosia2 (the mutual excitation code) easier.
C            This change affects only OP,FILE (optional--see below) and 
C            the default naming of files.  For example, on a typical Unix-like
C            system, the file formerly called "fort.2" will now be called 
C            "fort.12" and will contain the best set of matrix elements 
C            written at the end of the minimization.
C     
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Bugs Fixed  
C            The routine DJMM relies on the values of DJM being
C            preserved between repeated calls to DJMM, which occurred
C            automatically on many older systems (e.g. DEC Alpha, VAX).
C            On some newer machines, DJM was effectively randomized
C            between calls, causing unpredictable errors including
C            negative values of chi-squared.  This was fixed by adding
C            the command "SAVE DJM" to the routine DJMM.
C            The routine ALLOC now handles error conditions gracefully,
C            and execution is halted in the event of a fatal error.
C            The WRN,X. switch in the CONT section of OP,GOSI and 
C            OP,COUL was unintentionally disabled in the 2007 version.
C            It is restored in the present update.
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Explicit 64-bit Precision Upgrade 
C            All routines and functions including the main routine now
C            have "IMPLICIT NONE" declared, and all variables are
C            explicitly defined as either REAL*8, COMPLEX*16, or
C            INTEGER*4.  Numerical constants have been changed as
C            necessary to double precision.  Archaic functions have
C            been updated (below, "Archaic Functions"), in part to
C            preserve 64-bit precision during type-conversions.
C            (Precision in type conversion may be limited in some cases
C            by the compiler.)
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Structure and Standards  
C            Sections of the code have been restructured using Spag 
C            (Polyhedron Software) under the academic license.  This
C            included unraveling of loops and goto statements, and
C            indenting the source code to make loops and if statements
C            more obvious.  The initialization in the main routine has
C            been slightly restructured, mainly to make it similar to
C            the 2007 version of Gosia2.  Other sections have been
C            restructured for clarity, without altering their function
C            (e.g. WTHREJ).
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Common Blocks 
C            The common blocks ME2D, CCC, KIN, COEX, CAUX0, and LCZP
C            were re-ordered so that the 64-bit real variables come
C            before the 32-bit integer variables in order to
C            eliminate alignment problems.  Several unused common
C            blocks were removed from routines.
C
C          (July 2007, N. Warr) Archaic Functions
C            All instances of the following archaic functions have
C            been replaced by their modern counterparts.
C
C                Archaic    Replacement        Archaic    Replacement
C                IFIX       INT                MIN0       MIN  
C                FLOAT      REAL               AMIN1      MIN  
C                IABS       ABS                ALOG10     LOG10

C                AMAX1      MAX                
C         
C          (June 2006, T. Czosnyka) - The size of the array of
C            internal conversion coefficients (CC) has been increased
C            to 50.
C
C          (Nov 2000, T. Czosnyka) - A Jaeri efficiency calibration
C            has been added.
C
C          (2000) - A FITEFF efficiency calibration has been added
C            with credit to P. Olbratowski, P. Napiorkowski.
C
C          (July 1997, T. Czosnyka) - Known matrix elements of all
C            multipolarities may now be entered as data in OP,YIEL.
C            Note that this necessitates adding the multipole order
C            LAMBDA as the first field in the new input format:
C            LAMBDA, NS1, NS2, ME, DME 
C            where LAMBDA=7 and 8 represent M1 and M2, respectively.
C
C          (September 1996, T. Czosnyka) - The PIN diode particle
C            detector option has been added.  See the entry for
C            "PIN,X."  under the sub-option CONT in the Gosia manual.
C
C          (May 1995, T. Czosnyka) - Added a matrix element generator
C            "OP,THEO" following the "general structure of matrix
C            elements" as given in Bohr & Mottelson vol. II.  Refer to
C            the Gosia manual.
C
C          (April 1991, T. Czosnyka) - The OP,RAW function has been
C            added.  OP,RAW handles non-efficiency-corrected spectra
C            and allows the definition of Ge detector "clusters."  Up
C            to 20 clusters can be defined.  This effectively increases
C            the number of physical Ge detectors to 200, while the
C            number of data sets (i.e. single detectors + cluster
C            detectors) is still limited to 32.
C
C          (April 1991, T. Czosnyka) - Output is now written on unit
C            22 to avoid mixing it with system messages on some
C            systems.
C
C          (November 1990, T. Czosnyka) - The level scheme data
C            arrays have been increased to the following sizes:
C            number of levels   = 75
C            gamma-ray yields   = 32 x 1500 
C            magnetic substates = 600 
C            matrix elements    = 500
C
C
C          (April 1990, T. Czosnyka) - The dominant multipolarity
C            switch is now ignored by the code and does not need to be
C            set.  Full Q-maps are now calculated for electric
C            multipole orders E1 through E4.  The electric matrix
C            elements up to multipole order E6 may be entered and fit.
C            The Xi and Zeta function ranges are now calculated for
C            each multipolarity individually.
C
C          (1990, Eh. Vogt, T. Czosnyka) - OP,FILE has been added,
C            giving the user the option of specifying descriptive names
C            of the input and output files in the Gosia input, rather
C            than using the Fortran default names fort.1, fort.2, etc.
C            Refer to the Gosia website for sample input files that use
C            OP,FILE.
C
C          (March 1989, T. Czosnyka) - The code has been updated to
C            allow input of data from 32 Ge detectors.  [As of the 2007
C            version, this means a total of 32 X 1500 data points.]
C
C          (1980, T. Czosnyka, D. Cline, C.Y. Wu) - Original version.
