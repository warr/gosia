This is a test to check the OP,GDET option of gosia. There is an input file
generate_gdet.inp which should be piped to gosia and should generate a file
det.gdt. There is also a file det.gdt.good, which is the same thing
generated by Adam Hayes on his system, which is known to be good.

However, the commit 1f4c3b615f91f2920107b66ac927ea4bcf27e9b0 changed
the absoprtion coefficients to the NIST ones and this has an impact on
this test. So it now gives a noticeably different result.
