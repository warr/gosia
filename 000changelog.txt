* Explicitly initialise idr
* Correct errorbars on B(E2) values
* Write absolute value of lab angle
* Fix format for long lifetimes
* Change default value of DIPOL
* Reordering of all variable declarations so variables in common blocks are
  together.
* Increased size of arrays for levels from 75 to 100.
* Change in many format statements to accomodate 100 levels (I2 -> I3).
* Increased size of arrays for substates from 600 to 1200.
* Restructure function EFFIX to allow more flexible selection of efficiency
  calbration type.
* Added Radware efficiency calibration (Pawel J. Napiorkowski).
* Added EFF, option to CONT to make it easier to select efficiency method.
* Bugfix in gremlin efficiency method: a sign was wrong in Woods-Saxon term.
* Bugfix in initialisation of conversion coefficients for interpolation
  method (only part of array was initialized).
* Add CONTINUE statements to prevent GOTO the ENDDO of a loop. This is
  deprecated and will be removed in future.
* Call either LAGRAN or SPLNER to do interpolation according to ISPL variable.
* Approximation in TRINT  if Arg is very large (then ratio is one) as in
  pawel.
* Replaced OPEN(NAME=xxx) with OPEN(FILE=xxx) as the former is an extension
  to the language, while the latter is standard.
* Bugfix in BRICC: we need the absolute value of the difference in energy
  levels not the signed difference.
* Use JZB to indicate which unit to read from as in gosia2.
* Use IUNIT3 to indicate which unit is TAPE3 as in gosia2.
* Use irix variable to select units 7 and 12 as in gosia2.
* Add dummy variable Op2 to ANGULA as in gosia2.
* In OPENF we refuse to open units 25 and 26 unless reading from unit 5 as
  in gosia2 (however, gosia always reads from unit 5, so this does nothing).
* Bugfix for dimension of bten, which should have been 1600 and was
  different in different places.
* Use DCMPLX instead of CMPLX for portability.
* Use DIMAG instead of IMAG for portability.
* Reorder DATA statement in NEWCNV for portability.
* Use LAGRAN for interpolation if there are less than three data points even
  if ISPL = 1.
* Add E0 parameter to Leuven efficiency

20080519
* Add spline support (Pawel J. Napiorkowski).
* Add new version of CONV which can lookup internal conversion coefficients
  from a table, which must have all the necessary energies (no interpolation).
* Add OP,BRIC to use BrIcc database to generate conversion coefficient table
  for new version of CONV.

20080508
* Increased size of arrays for matrix elements from 500 to 1500. N.B. we are
  still limited to 999 matrix elements because 1000 is used as a flag.
* Added OP,SELE.

20080507
* Correct inaccurate constants in SEQ.
* Replaced constant 10 with NLIFT in loop (this was a bug).
* Initialized some variables explicitly to remove compiler warnings.
* Increased AKAVKA dimensions from 8 to 9 to prepare for merge of Pawel
  Napiorkowski's efficiency code.
* Added ISPL variable in CCC common to prepare for merge of Pawel
  Napiorkowski's spline code and SPL, option in CONT.
* Restructured a repeated IF with the same condition to use IF/THEN.

20080418
* Increased dimensions of arrays fiex1, wpi in GOSIA.
* Increased dimensions of XV, YV, ZV, DSG and DSE in GOSIA.
* Moved OP,EXIT code to end of GOSIA (as in gosia2).
* Limited ABS(NI2) rather than NI2 to 50 in GOSIA.
* Fixed call to MIN so both parameters have same precision in GOSIA.
* Remove unused variables u and v in ALLOC.
* Changed format of normalisation coefficients write in CEGRY.
* Changed dimensions of X, Y, w and arh in LAGRAN.
* Changed dimensions of XV, YV, ZV, DSG and DSE in TAPMA.
* Changed dimensions of Wpi in COORD.
* Changed dimensions of XV, YV, ZV, DSG and DSE in COORD.
* Changed dimensions of XV, YV, ZV, DSG and DSE in KONTUR.
* Added Leuven efficiency calibration in EFFIX (as in gosia2).

20080328
* Put back warnings in CEGRY which was removed by mistake.
* Fix typo misspelling "WARNING" in CEGRY.

20080229
* Limit NI2 to 50 in GOSIA.

20070726
* Reorder initialisation so it is similar to gosia2 in GOSIA.
* Remove spurious attempt to provoke floating point exception in ALLOC.
* Remove superfluous ELSE in WTHREJ.
* Move some format statements in PRELM.

20070721
* Fix initialisation of CNOR from 1 to 75 not 1 to 50 in GOSIA.
* Make both parameters of SIGN have same precision in FXIS1.

20070709
* Restucture IF statement in GOSIA.
* Add explicit STOP statement to ALLOC.
* Move duplicated lines out of IF/ELSE in MINI.
* Make both parameters of SIGN have same precision in FXIS2.
* Run spag.
* Convert to double precision.
* Reorder common LCZP.
* Reorder common CAUX0.
* Reorder common COEX.
* Reorder common KIN.
* Reorder common CCC.
* Reorder common ME2D.
* Declare all variables explicitly.
* Add PROGRAM statement to GOSIA.
* Replace ALOG with LOG.
* Replace ALOG10 with LOG10.
* Replace AMIN1 with MIN.
* Replace MIN0 with MIN.
* Replace AMAX1 with MAX.
* Replace MAX0 with MAX.
* Replace IABS with ABS.
* Replace FLOAT with REAL.
* Replace IFIX with INT.
* Add SAVE statement in DJMM.
