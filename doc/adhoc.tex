\section{ADHOC}
\label{sect:adhoc}

\noindent This function is called to handle the OP,YIEL option. It reads the
parameters for OP,YIEL from the input file, then sorts the levels into
``chronological'' order by calling {\em SEQ} (see section \ref{sect:seq}).
It uses {\em READY} (see section \ref{sect:ready}) to read the experimental
yield file.\\
