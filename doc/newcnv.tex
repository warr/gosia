\section{NEWCNV}
\label{sect:newcnv}

\noindent This function returns the internal conversion coefficient for a
given energy and multipolarity. The value must have been previously obtained
from the Bricc database and interpolated for each of the $\gamma$-ray
energies needed for the calculation using the OP,BRIC option.\\
