\section{STAMP}
\label{sect:stamp}

\noindent This function estimates the amplitude by approximating the Coulomb
interaction strengths using sine and cosine integrals. These are evaluated by
{\em TRINT} (see section \ref{sect:trint}).\\

\noindent These are effective strength parameters, which are only functions
of $\epsilon$ and $\xi$, so for a given experiment, assuming the
eccentricity $\epsilon$ to be constant, we only need to evaluate them as a
function of $\xi$.\\
