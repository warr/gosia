\section{TENB}
\label{sect:tenb}

\noindent This function calculates the state of polarization of the decaying
level.\\

\noindent Note that as we call {\em WTHREJ} (see section \ref{sect:wthrej}) to
evaluate a Wigner 3-j symbol the spins are doubled so that half-integers can
be handled as integers.\\
