\section{CMLAB}
\label{sect:cmlab}

\noindent This function calculates for the change from the laboratory frame
into the centre-of-mass frame.\\

\noindent This calculation can be performed for a single experiment (in
which case the first parameter is the experiment number), or for all
experiments (in which case the first parameter is zero).\\

\noindent This function also calculates the Jacobian relating the solid
angles in the centre-of-mass frame to those in the laboratory frame.\\
