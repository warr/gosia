\section{CCLKUP}
\label{sect:cclkup}

\noindent This function looks up the conversion coefficient for a
given Z, energy and multipolarity in the BrIcc database, interpolating
for the right energy using a cubic spline on a log-log scale.\\

\noindent It is based on the BrIcc code and uses {\em SPLNER} (see
section \ref{sect:splner}) to evaluate the cubic spline.\\

\noindent Note that the BrIcc method avoids the problem of edges by
treating each subshell separately. Rather than have a database of
conversion coefficients for each multipolarity and atomic number, it
has the contribution of each subshell for each multipolarity and
atomic number. At the edges, one subshell suddenly kicks in causing a
jump in the conversion coefficient, but this is easy to handle for
BrIcc, because below that energy, that subshell does not contribute at
all to the sum and above it, it is well behaved.\\
