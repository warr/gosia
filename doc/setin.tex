\section{SETIN}
\label{sect:setin}

\noindent This function evaluates the adiabatic parameter:\\

\begin{equation}
\epsilon \sinh(\omega) + \omega
\end{equation}

\noindent It uses the tables of $\sinh$ which were calculated by {\em FHIP}
(see section \ref{sect:fhip})and stored in the {\em SH} array of common block
HIPER. The results are stored in the {\em ADB} array of common block ADX. Note
that both {\em SH} and {\em ADB} are in steps of $\Delta\omega$ which is
0.03.\\

\noindent A maximum of 365 values can fit in this array.\\
