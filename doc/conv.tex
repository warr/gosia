\section{CONV}
\label{sect:conv}

\noindent This function calculates the internal conversion coefficients.
Either it uses the data provided by the user and interpolates, which is not
very good in the vicinity of edges, where the derivative is not continuous.
Or if the user provided a negative or zero number of conversion
coefficients, it uses the Bricc method, by simply calling {\em NEWCNV} (see
section \ref{sect:newcnv}.\\

\noindent If the user has selected the spline option then {\em SPLNER} (see
section \ref{sect:splner}) is used for the interpolation, otherwise {\em
LAGRAN} (see section \ref{sect:lagran}) is used.\\
