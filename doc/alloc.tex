\section{ALLOC}
\label{sect:alloc}

\noindent This function calculates and stores the ranges of integration over
$\omega$ for each multipolarity based on the desired accuracy. It calls the
function {\em RANGEL} to calculate this range (see section
\ref{sect:rangel}).\\

\noindent This function sets up the {\em LOCQ} array to point to the start
of each collision function for each multipolarity obtaining the number of
values needed for each multipolarity (calculated in {\em RANGEL}) from the
variable {\em IRA}.\\
