\section{ANGULA}
\label{sect:angula}

\noindent This function calculates the angular distribution of the emitted
$\gamma$ rays. We loop over the decays in {\em KSEQ} which are ordered
starting from the top of the level scheme working down. Then we calculate
the decay between each pair of levels, using the F coefficients and $\delta$
values together with the statistical tensors, which are stored at the
beginning of the ZETA block.\\

\noindent The function {\em RECOIL} is used to perform a relativistic
correction (see section \ref{sect:recoil}). The function {\em FIINT1} (see
section \ref{sect:fiint1}) is used to integrate over $\phi$ in the lab
frame, while {\em FIINT} (see section \ref{sect:fiint}) is used to do that
in the frame of the recoiling nucleus. The functions {\em YLM} and {\em
YLM1} (see sections \ref{sect:ylm} and \ref{sect:ylm}) are used to calculate
the spherical harmonics.\\
