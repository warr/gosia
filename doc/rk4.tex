\section{RK4}
\label{sect:rk4}

\noindent This function is called by {\em KONTUR}. Is it some sort of 4$^{th}$
order Runge-Kutta method?\\

\noindent It evaluates:\\

\begin{equation}
\mathrm{RK4} = y + {h \over 6} (f_1 + 4 f_2 + f_3)
\end{equation}

\noindent Actually, despite the name, which is a common abbreviation for the
fourth order Runge-Kutta method, this seems to be the third order!\\
