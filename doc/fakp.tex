\section{FAKP}
\label{sect:fakp}

\noindent This function calculates the log of primes, the factoring of
primes and the sum of factors of primes. They are stored in PILOG, IPI and
KF in the {\em FAKUL} common block. They are used for evaluating the Wigner
3-j and 6-j symbols (see sections \ref{sect:wthrej} and \ref{sect:wsixj}).\\
