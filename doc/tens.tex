\section{TENS}
\label{sect:tens}

\noindent For each level, we take the stastical tensor describing the
polarization of the level (Bten) and rotate it into the new coordinate system
with the z-axis along the beam direction and the x-axis in the plane of the
orbit in such a way, that the x-component of the impact parameter is positive.
The y- axis is defined to form a right-handed system. The results are written
to ZETA.\\
