Separate the different things in the {\em ZETA} array.\\

Try to decouple some of the variables in common blocks from the functions.
For example, {\em YLM} need common block {\em KIN} only for the axial
symmetry flag for the current experiment, which could be passed to it as a
formal parameter of the function.\\

Why do we need {\em YLM} and {\em YLM1}? Why don't we have a single function
to generate all these values and pass flags to it, to turn off the
calculation of those which we are not going to used.\\

In {\em GKK}, the variable {\em SUM} is in a common block, but it doesn't
seem to be used anywhere else, so why don't we just make it STATIC?\\

In line 1895 of gosia.f we have to successive tests on iosr, which could be
merged into an IF (iosr.eq.1) then {\ldots} endif construction.\\

There are some integer flags, which should be replaced with logicals. This
would prevent them accidently being given values $>$ 1.\\
