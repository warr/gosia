\section{OPENF}
\label{sect:openf}

\noindent This function handles the OP,FILE option, opening files associated
with the fortran units specified by the user. It reads three integers from
the input unit, the first of which is the unit to use for the open
statement. The second is 1 if the file is required to exist already, 2 if it
is required not to exist and 3 if it does not matter. The third is 1 if the
file is formatted and 2 if it is unformatted. A second line is read, which
gives the name of the file to associate with that unit. If the unit is zero,
the function returns. It keeps looping until a unit zero is reached.\\
