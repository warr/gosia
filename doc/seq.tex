\section{SEQ}
\label{sect:seq}

\noindent This function sorts out the levels starting from the top and
working down. i.e. in the order of the cascade. This allows us to take care
of feeding.\\

\noindent It fills out the {\em KSEQ} array in the {\em LEV} common block
for each decay with four values: The initial level, the final level, the
matrix element and the multipolarity.\\
