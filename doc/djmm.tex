\section{DJMM}
\label{sect:djmm}

\noindent This function calculates the rotation matrices $D^k_{\xi
\xi^\prime}$ needed to switch between the lab frame and the frame of the
moving particle.\\

\noindent In order to optimize things, we save the values already
calculated, so they can be returned straight away without having to
recalculate them.\\
