\section{BRICC}
\label{sect:bricc}

\noindent This function evaulates the internal conversion coefficients
using the BrIcc database for each transition energy that gosia needs.
The results are stored in a file, which is read in the first time {\em
CONV} (see section \ref{sect:conv}) is called.\\

\noindent First it opens the BrIcc database files (an index file and
one containing the values). Then for each matrix element, it
calculates the transition energy and checks if it already has this
energy. If not, it uses {\em CCLKUP} (see section \ref{sect:cclkup})
to calculate the contribution for E1, E2, E3, M1 and M2 for that
transition.\\
