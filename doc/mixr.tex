\section{MIXR}
\label{sect:mixr}

\noindent This function calculates the theoretical mixing ratio and compares
it to the experimental one, adding the appropriate amount to $\chi^2$ and
the log of $\chi^2$.\\

\begin{equation}
\delta = \sqrt{\ln 2} E_\gamma {m.e. 1 \over m.e. 2}
\end{equation}

\noindent In the code $\sqrt{ln 2}$ is given in {\em ADHOC} (see section
\ref{sect:adhoc} as 0.8326 and the $\sqrt{\ln 2} E_\gamma$ part is stored in
the variable {\em DMIX} there. In {\em MIXR}, this is multiplied by the
ratio of the matrix elements.\\
