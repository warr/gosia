\section{SNAKE}
\label{sect:snake}

\noindent This function is used to store the dimensionless collision
functions $Q_e$ and $Q_m$. It does not actually calculate them, but
calls the functions QE and QM (see sections \ref{sect:qe} and
\ref{sect:qm}) to do this. However, it evaluates various parameters
such as $\sinh\omega$ and $\cosh\omega$, $(\epsilon \cosh\omega + 1)$,
this value raised to various powers and $\sinh\omega \sqrt{\epsilon^2 -
1}$ etc.\\
