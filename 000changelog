20080519.1
° Use FILE= not NAME= in OPEN statement.
° Fix sign in Woods-Saxon part of gremlin efficiency in EFFIX.
° Gamma energy must be positive in BRICC.
° Bugfix: only first 20 elements of CC were initialised.
° Allow arbitrary arrays to be passed as Bten for TENB, TENS, KONTUR, FTBM
  and MINI.
° Allow larger dimensions for interpolation in EFFIX and CONV.
° Remove the GOTO statements which go to the ENDDO of a loop by adding a
  CONTINUE statement.
° Add E0 parameter to Leuven efficiency

20080519
° Add spline support (Pawel J. Napiorkowski)
° Add new version of CONV which can lookup internal conversion coefficients
  from a table, which must have all the necessary energies (no interpolation)
° Add OP,BRIC to use BrIcc database to generate conversion coefficient table
  for new version of CONV.

20080508
° Increased size of arrays for matrix elements from 500 to 1500. N.B. we are
  still limited to 999 matrix elements because 1000 is used as a flag.
° Added OP,SELE

20080507
° Correct inaccurate constants in SEQ
° Replaced constant 10 with NLIFT in loop (this was a bug)
° Initialized some variables explicitly to remove compiler warnings
° Increased AKAVKA dimensions from 8 to 9 to prepare for merge of Pawel
  Napiorkowski's efficiency code
° Added ISPL variable in CCC common to prepare for merge of Pawel
  Napiorkowski's spline code and SPL, option in CONT
° Restructured a repeated IF with the same condition to use IF/THEN

20080418

° Increased dimensions of XV, YV, ZV, DSG and DSE in GOSIA
° Moved OP,EXIT code to end of GOSIA (as in gosia2)
° Limited ABS(NI2) rather than NI2 to 50 in GOSIA
° Fixed call to MIN so both parameters have same precision in GOSIA
° Remove unused variables u and v in ALLOC
° Changed format of normalisation coefficients write in CEGRY
° Changed dimensions of X, Y, w and arh in LAGRAN
° Changed dimensions of XV, YV, ZV, DSG and DSE in TAPMA

° Fix typo misspelling "WARNING" in CEGRY

20080229
° Limit NI2 to 50 in GOSIA

20070726

° Remove spurious attempt to provoke floating point exception in ALLOC
° Remove superfluous ELSE in WTHREJ
° Move some format statements in PRELM

20070721
° Fix initialisation of CNOR from 1 to 75 not 1 to 50 in GOSIA
° Make both parameters of SIGN have same precision in FXIS1

20070709
° Restucture IF statement in GOSIA
° Add explicit STOP statement to ALLOC
° Move duplicated lines out of IF/ELSE in MINI
° Make both parameters of SIGN have same precision in FXIS2
° Run spag
° Convert to double precision
° Reorder common LCZP
° Reorder common CAUX0
° Reorder common COEX
° Reorder common KIN
° Reorder common CCC
° Reorder common ME2D
